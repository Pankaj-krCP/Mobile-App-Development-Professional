## Building a Website with Multiple Pages

### Anchor Tag

- Used to create hyperlinks between web pages.
- Example: `<a href="location.html">Our Location</a>`
- 🔗 Creates clickable links on the webpage.

### Creating a New Page

- Right-click in the explorer panel to create a new file (e.g., location.html).
- Use the same file structure as the index.html but add new content.

### Adding Content to New Page

- Add a heading using `<h1>` tag (e.g., `<h1>Our Location</h1>`).
- Add a paragraph with the address (e.g., `<p>123 Rome Road, Main Districts capital city.</p>`).

### Linking Pages

- In index.html, add an anchor tag with the href attribute pointing to location.html.
- Example: `<a href="location.html">Our Location</a>`
- 🌐 Links the index page to the location page.
