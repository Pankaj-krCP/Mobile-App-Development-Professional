## What is Web Hosting?

- Web hosting is a service where you place your website and files on a hosting company's web server.
- You rent space on the server in return for stable and secure storage.
- Individuals can rent space too, so you don't need your own datacenter.

## Types of Web Hosting Services:

1. **Shared Hosting** 🔄

   - Cheapest form of hosting.
   - You share server resources with other websites, which can affect performance.
   - Best for small websites with low traffic.

2. **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** 🚪

   - A virtual server with dedicated CPU, memory, and bandwidth resources.
   - Resources are fixed per VPS instance, ensuring consistent performance.
   - More expensive than shared hosting.

3. **Dedicated Hosting** 🚀

   - A hardware server dedicated to your website.
   - All hardware resources are yours to use.
   - Generally more expensive than VPS hosting.

4. **Cloud Hosting** ☁️
   - Your website runs in a cloud environment across multiple servers.
   - If one server fails, your website switches to another server, ensuring uptime.
