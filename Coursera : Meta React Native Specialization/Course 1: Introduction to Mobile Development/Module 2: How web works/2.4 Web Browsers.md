# Web Browsers 🌐🔍

## What is a Web Browser?

- A web browser is a software application used to browse the World Wide Web.
- It sends requests to web servers and displays the received content on your device's screen.

## Request-Response Cycle 🔄

- The browser sends a request to a web server using a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
- The URL contains the protocol (HTTP), domain name (website name), and file path (page path).
- The server responds with the requested content using the HTTP protocol.
- The browser receives and displays the content on your device's screen.

## Example: Searching the Web 🔎

- Open a web browser and type the search engine's name in the address bar.
- Press Enter to send a request to the search engine's web server.
- The server responds with the search engine's webpage, which is displayed on your screen.
- Type a search query (e.g., "restaurants near me") and press the search button.
- The browser sends a new request to the search engine's web server with the search query.
- The server processes the request, retrieves relevant data from a database, and sends it back to the browser.
- The browser displays the search results, including links to restaurants, a map, and related information.

## Conclusion 🎉

- Web browsers use the request-response cycle to communicate with web servers and display content on your device.
- Understanding how web browsers work can help you navigate the web more efficiently and appreciate the complexity of the internet.
