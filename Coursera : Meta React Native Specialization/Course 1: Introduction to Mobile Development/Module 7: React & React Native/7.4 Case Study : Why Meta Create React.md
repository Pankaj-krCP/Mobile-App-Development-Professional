# 🧐 Why Did Meta Engineers Create React?

## 🏗️ Building Composable User Interfaces

- **Not MVC**: React is not an MVC framework; it's a library for building composable user interfaces.
- **Component-based**: It encourages the creation of reusable UI components that present data changing over time.
- **No Templates**: Unlike traditional approaches using templates or HTML directives, React breaks UIs into components, using JavaScript to render views.
- **Advantages of Using JavaScript**:
  - Flexibility and power to build abstractions.
  - Easier to extend and maintain views.
  - Reduced surface area for XSS vulnerabilities.
- **JSX**: Optional syntax extension for those who prefer HTML-like readability.

## 🔄 Simple Updates

- **Efficient Data Changes**: React shines when data changes over time.
- **React's Approach**:
  - Renders a lightweight representation of the view.
  - Compares previous and new renders to generate minimal DOM changes.
- **Reconciliation**: React's process of updating the DOM efficiently.

## 🌐 Beyond HTML

- **Lightweight Representation**: React's own representation of the document allows for:
  - Dynamic charts rendering to `<canvas>`.
  - Instagram's single-page app built with React and Backbone.Router.
  - Running React apps in web workers and driving native iOS views via an Objective-C bridge.
  - Running React on the server for SEO, performance, and flexibility.
  - Consistent event behavior in all browsers, including IE8, with automatic event delegation.
