## 🌳 Component Hierarchy in React

- **Root Component**: Every React application has at least one root component, often called the app component.
- **Tree Structure**: Components are added to the app component to create a tree structure, forming the application.

## 🏗️ Building a Website with Components

- **Example - Blog Website**: Components like Navbar, Page, Main Feature, and Small Feature are used to construct the website.
- **Component Hierarchy**: The app component is the root, containing Navbar and Page components. Page further contains Main Feature and two Small Feature components.
- **Code Reusability**: Components like Small Feature can be reused with different properties, streamlining development.

## 🧩 Benefits of Component-Based Development

- **Code Reusability**: Components can be reused across the application, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
- **Hierarchy Clarity**: Component hierarchy provides a clear structure for building and organizing complex applications.
- **Efficiency**: Once familiar with component-based development, it becomes easier and quicker to plan and build applications.
