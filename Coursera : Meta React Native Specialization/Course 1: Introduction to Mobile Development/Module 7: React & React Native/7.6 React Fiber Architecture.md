## üå± React Fiber Architecture

- **Optimizing DOM Updates**: Fiber Architecture allows React to update the browser DOM incrementally, reducing the number of updates and improving performance.
- **Incremental Rendering**: Instead of updating all virtual DOM changes at once, React spreads updates over time.
- **Example Scenario**: In a long webpage, updates to non-visible elements are deferred, prioritizing visible elements for immediate update.
- **Performance Improvement**: React optimizes updates based on visibility and user interaction, enhancing application responsiveness.
- **Priority System**: Updates are prioritized based on user visibility, ensuring higher priority changes are applied first.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

- **React Developer Tools**: Official plugin by Meta for inspecting React components and debugging.
- **Essential for Troubleshooting**: These tools are crucial for understanding how React processes your webpage and diagnosing issues.
- **Recommended Usage**: While direct interaction with the virtual DOM and Fiber Architecture is rare, these tools are invaluable for optimizing and debugging your web application.
