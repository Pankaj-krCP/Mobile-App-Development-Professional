# üì± Emulation in Mobile App Development

## üéÆ What is Emulation?

- **Definition**: Emulation is copying or imitating one system with another.
- **Example**: Playing classic video games on modern devices through emulation.

## üñ•Ô∏è Emulation in Software Development

- **Definition**: Emulator is hardware or software allowing one system to imitate another.
- **Purpose**: Enables running software or devices designed for the emulated system.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Emulation Works for Mobile App Development

- **Usage**: Developers use emulators to test mobile apps on computer hardware.
- **Purpose**: Emulate mobile operating systems like iOS and Android.
- **Capabilities**: Replicates device specifications such as RAM, processor, screen size, and storage.
- **Benefits**: Saves time and money by replicating end user's devices for testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Limitations of Emulators

- **iOS Environment**: Some aspects of the native mobile environment cannot be emulated on a PC.
- **Resource Intensive**: Emulators can strain processor, battery, and storage, making app function slightly slower.

## üß™ Testing Apps

- **Testing Practice**: Standard to test apps on both emulated environment and physical devices.
- **Viability**: Not always feasible due to the variety of devices in the market.

## üí° Examples of Emulators

- **Platform-Specific Emulators**: Examples include Android Studio for Android and XCode for iOS.
- **Online Emulation Services**: Examples include Appetizer.io. since some IDE not includes emulator, that suggest to use third party emulator.
