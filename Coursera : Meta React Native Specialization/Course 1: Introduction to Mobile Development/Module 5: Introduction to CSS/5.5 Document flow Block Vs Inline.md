### Understanding Block and Inline Elements in HTML ðŸ§±ðŸ”¤

- **Document Flow**: Web browsers use document flow to calculate the position of HTML elements on the screen. Elements are categorized into two main types: **block** and **inline** elements.

- **Block Level Elements**:

  - Occupy the full horizontal width of their parent element.
  - Have a new line before and after them, causing them to stack on top of each other.
  - Examples include `<div>`, `<form>`, and heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).

- **Inline Elements**:

  - Only occupy the width and height of their content.
  - Do not start on a new line, allowing them to form a row of elements.
  - Examples include `<a>`, `<img>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, and `<span>`.

- **Changing Display Types**:

  - You can change an element's display type using the CSS `display` property.
  - Use `display: block;` to make an element a block-level element, and `display: inline;` to make it an inline element.

### Example:

- A `<div>` element containing three sentences of placeholder text (`Lorem Ipsum`).
- Each sentence has a `<span>` element, which is an inline element.
- Initially, all text is displayed in an unbroken flow of content.

- **Changing Elements**:

  - Changing the middle sentence from a `<span>` to a `<div>` moves the sentence to a new line, along with the following `<span>` element.
  - This demonstrates the difference between block and inline elements.

- **Using CSS**:

  - Adding a CSS file (`style.css`) and giving the middle sentence `<div>` an ID.
  - Using CSS rules (`display: inline;`) to change the element to an inline element.
  - Removing the rule to revert the element to a block-level element (`display: block;`).
