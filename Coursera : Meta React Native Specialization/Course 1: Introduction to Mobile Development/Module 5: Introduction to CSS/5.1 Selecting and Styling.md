### CSS as Decoration (Web Design)

- **Analogy**: CSS is like paint, wallpaper, fixtures, and artwork in a physical building. It provides the look and feel of a website. üé®üñºÔ∏è

### CSS Basics

- **Selector**: Indicates which HTML elements to style (e.g., `h1` selects all `<h1>` elements).
- **Declaration Block**: Contains style declarations inside curly brackets.
- **Property and Value**: Each declaration consists of a property (e.g., `color`) and a value (e.g., `blue`).
- **Applying CSS**: Link CSS file to HTML using `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.
- **Styling Elements**: Use selectors to apply styles to specific elements, such as changing text color (`color: purple;`).
- **Specificity**: ID selectors (`#header1`) have higher precedence than HTML type selectors (`h1`). Use the most specific selector for the desired effect.

### here's an example demonstrating the use of CSS to style HTML elements:

#### HTML (index.html)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>CSS Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS (style.css)

```css
/* Styles for all h1 elements */
h1 {
  color: blue;
  background-color: lightgray;
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Styles for all p elements */
p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

/* Styles for specific element with ID */
#special-paragraph {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, the CSS file (`style.css`) is linked to the HTML file (`index.html`). The CSS styles are applied to various HTML elements, such as `<h1>` and `<p>`. The `#special-paragraph` selector demonstrates how to target a specific element with an ID.
